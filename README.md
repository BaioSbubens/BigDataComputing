# Big Data Computing  

This repository contains two main directories:  

## 1. Outlier Detection with PySpark  
This directory includes:  
- Code for detecting outliers using PySpark in a distributed system, leveraging the MapReduce implementation of the Farthest-First Traversal algorithm.
- The Uber fare dataset.  
- The output generated using an artificially created large dataset. The computation was performed on Cloud Veneto, the University of Padua's computing cluster.

## 2. Frequent Item Detection in Streaming Settings  
This directory includes:  
- Code for identifying the most frequent items in a data stream.  
- Implementations of various algorithms, such as **Reservoir Sampling** and **Sticky Sampling** and the comparison with the **Exact Algorithm** .
